# `HEALTHCHECK`

This is an example set of prototype images (available under https://hub.docker.com/u/healthcheck) for enabling [`HEALTHCHECK`](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/21142) behavior in the official images.

These images are not maintained and are only provided as a reference in implementing your own `HEALTHCHECK`.
