# `HEALTHCHECK`

This is an example set of prototypes for enabling [`HEALTHCHECK`](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/21142) behavior in select official images.

This repository is not actively maintained and only exists as a reference in implementing your own `HEALTHCHECK` which meets your particular needs more accurately than these generic examples possibly could. Resulting images are **not** actively built and pushed to a Docker Registry (and the `FROM` lines are likely even outdated).

See [the `HEALTHCHECK` FAQ entry](https://github.com/docker-library/faq#healthcheck) for the rationale for why these don't get added to the official images directly.
